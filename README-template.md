## Overview

### Profile Card Component Challenge


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
<>HTML
<h1>I learnt how to structure my HTML in an orderly fashion which helps a great deal in setting up a well arranged web page</h1>
<span>Building this project helped me understand more about the various HTML tags, its uniqueness and functions</span>

```CSS
body{
  background: With this project i clearly learnt the use and difference between background,background-colour and background-image;
}
body .content{
  style:i learnt to style and position the elements in the page and had the liberty of knowing how to with the margin-top,padding-left etc.. and also using the shorthand methods;
}

### Continued development

I plan to learn more and get better at arranging a well structured HTML and custom my CSS to get better designs. 
I'll continue to build and complete as many more projects as i can to get better and begin more projects involving 
CSS_GRID, @media_queries, and also learn a CSS frame work
